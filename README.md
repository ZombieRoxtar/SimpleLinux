Simple Linux Programs (Designed for WSL)

After playing with WSL for two days, I'd already added one SH and one ELF to my bin.
This is where I will share more.

explainLS.sh - Display the coloraztion rules for LS; since the rules vary by distro this is a great dynamic script.

Winpath.cpp - Displays a Windows friendly pathname based on the current working directory. This is useful for easily jumping from WSL to Windows Explorer. (Compile with g++ for x64)
